The tower is, of course, strikingly redundant—an inept attempt to satisfy the vague sense that something is missing, another useless thingy to add to Stratford’s menagerie of future relics. But its uselessness is to the point: Boris Johnson and Anish Kapoor have said that the tower is ‘mythic,’ which both acknowledges its unreality and reveals that they want more than they know how to get.</p>","textalign":"","textaligntablet":"","textalignmobile":"","textsize":"","texttransform":"","textwrapping":"","textcolor":""},"id":"a7a5bcab-5a71-437a-b880-9cc36ed7dd9b","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://e9LVA6wn6rdYJVJh"],"src":"","ratio":"","alt":"","resizewidth":"","caption":"","captionclass":"false","width":"","widthmobile":"","align":"","float":"","borderradius":"uk-border-rounded","shadow":" uk-box-shadow-medium","linkoption":"","link":"","newtab":"false"},"id":"6e2438cf-94ba-4977-91fd-08f87742a0a7","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>If this picture of things begins to unnerve rather than inspire, we might start to hedge our bets, we might start to feel adrift and crave the certainty of a centre, the magic of a tower.
